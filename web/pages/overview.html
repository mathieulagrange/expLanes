<p><strong>Experimentation and testing are a fundamental part of scientific research.</strong> They're also extremely time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone unless properly managed. <strong>expLanes (EXPerimental PLANning for Engineering and Science)</strong> is here to take care for you of the management, running and reporting of your experiments, letting you focus on the creative part of the research work.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 50px">What can expLanes do for you?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Set up an experimental protocol once, and <strong>re-run</strong> it as often as needed with minimum hassle using new data, modified code, or alternative hypotheses</li>
  <li>Automatically <strong>explore</strong> many combinations of operational parameters in a system.</li>
  <li>Easily <strong>deploy</strong> your experiment on many computers on a network.</li>
  <li><strong>Re-use</strong> earlier results to only compute the later stages of a process, thus cutting down the running time.</li>
  <li>Automatically produce neatly formatted <strong>tables and graphs</strong> to study the results and embed them in publications.</li>
  <li>Keep experimental code, data and results <strong>organized</strong> in a standard way, to ease cooperation with others and allow you to go back painlessly on months-old or years-old work.</li>
</ul>
